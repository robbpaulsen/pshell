CFML v0.10.0 Changelog:

- Added `cflocation` to the default list of tags that do not need a closing tag
  https://github.com/jcberquist/sublimetext-cfml/issues/25

- Relative paths are now supported in `.sublime-project` files for paths specified
  for mappings, cfc folders, and custom tags. When a relative path is used, it is
  understood to be relative to the location of the `.sublime-project` file.
  (Just as Sublime Text itself resolves relative folder paths in project files.)
  https://github.com/jcberquist/sublimetext-cfml/issues/26

- Added syntax highlighting support for function parameter hints and metadata
  specified inline with the parameter (e.g. `required string varName hint="hint"`)

- Added a new command (bound by default to SHIFT+ALT+d), that when run will insert a
  property into a component based on a project's indexed component variable names.
  If the cursor's current position can be resolved to a component name, that name will
  be set in the property, otherwise, a list of the project's indexed component names will
  be offered from which a component name can be chosen. See `Inject Property Command` in
