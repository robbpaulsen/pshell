CFML v0.27.0 Changelog:

- Using `CTRL+ALT+Left Click` on builtin functions and tags will now open the
  cfdocs.org page for that function or tag in your default browser.

BREAKING CHANGE

- The CFScript formatting feature has been substantially overhauled.

  The format settings file structure has been flattened so that it no longer
  contains any nested objects. Instead those settings are now contained in top
  level keys that use periods to denote namespaces. (So, for example, you will
  see keys such as "array.padding_inside".) This change allows for more
  granular overriding of the default settings.

  In addition, this change will make the format settings compatible with
  "PackageDev" (https://packagecontrol.io/packages/PackageDev). PackageDev
  provides completions and popup docs for settings files, as well as more
  targeted syntax highlighting. (For this reason I highly recommend it, even if
  you don't intend to develop any ST packages.)

  However, this means that if you are currently formatting CFScript with
  this package, your current user defined settings WILL NOT WORK until you
  update them to this new structure.

  Please read through the default settings file to see the updated formatting
  options.
