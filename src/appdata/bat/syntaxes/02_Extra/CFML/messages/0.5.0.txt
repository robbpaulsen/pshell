CFML v0.5.0 Changelog:

- Breaking change:
  The per project "model_completion_folders" setting has been replaced with a "cfc_folders" setting.
  This update includes improvements to how CFCs are indexed, and allows for greater customization of
  the variable names for which it will provide CFC method completions. For complete information on
  this update please see:

  The short version:
  If you were using "model_completion_folders", to restore the current behavior you will need to make
  the following change:

  from
  "model_completion_folders": [ "C:/full/path/to/model" ]

  to
  "cfc_folders": [{"path": "C:/full/path/to/model", "variable_names": ["{cfc}","{cfc}{cfc_folder_singularized}"], "accessors": false}]

- Added support for per project mappings
  These are used to convert file system paths to CFC dot paths and the reverse. They are also used
  in conjunction with CFC folder indexing to resolve dot paths in the extends attribute of indexed
  CFCs. For complete information on this feature please see:
