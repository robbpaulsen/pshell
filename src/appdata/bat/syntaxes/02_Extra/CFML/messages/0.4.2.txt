CFML v0.4.2 Changelog:

- Fixed some bugs in the Testbox test runner code

- After a tag attribute value completion has been inserted (between ""),
  the cursor is now automatically advanced past the second double quote

- Added a package setting, "cfdocs_path", which is for use when you have a
  copy of the cfdocs.org GitHub repository on your file system (or at least
  its data directory). It should be set to the local file system path to the
  data directory of the cfdocs.org git repository. For example:

  "cfdocs_path": "C:/github/cfdocs/data/en/"

  When this is set, the F1 documentation command will load cfdocs.org data from
  the file system instead of fetching it via http request.
