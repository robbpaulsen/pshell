CFML v0.22.0 Changelog:

- Moved from separate menu entries for opening default package setting files and
  user package setting files to one entry for each that opens the default and
  user files side by side (as Sublime Text itself now does for its settings
  files).

- Inline documentation popups now make use of styling that adapts to the current
  color scheme. (e.g. Color schemes with a dark background will now get popups
  with a dark background as well.) You can disable this behavior by setting the
  package setting `adaptive_doc_styles` to false in your user package settings.

- Added a new testbox reporter: "compacttext". There are now two options for the
  text output when tests are run, "text" and "compacttext". This is controlled
  by the setting `testbox.reporter` and can be set in your package settings, project
  settings, or in a box.json file at the root of  your project. The "compacttext"
  style output is courtesy of work done by John Whish (@aliaspooryorik).

- Added `TRUNCATE TABLE` and `BULK INSERT` to the list of strings that trigger
  SQL string highlighting
