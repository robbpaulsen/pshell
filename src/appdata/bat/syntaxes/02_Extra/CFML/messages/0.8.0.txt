CFML v0.8.0 Changelog:

- Support for completions and documentation in the active CFC file

  When editing a CFC, completions for the methods of that component are
  now offered; this includes offering completions after typing `this.`.
  If the component extends another component and that parent component is
  contained in a project index, then you will also be offered completions
  from the parent component, as well as completions after typing `super.`.

  The F1 documentation command and CTRL-ALT-Click can be used on component
  method calls, as well as on the `this` and `super` keywords.

- Source code preview when using the F1 documentation command on CFC methods has
  been added. This is somewhat experimental, and feedback is welcome. Please note
  that it will currently truncate longer functions in order to avoid crashing
  Sublime Text.

- Fixed several issues reported on GitHub

- Updated regex patterns used in syntax to remove those not compatible with Sublime
  Text's new regex engine

- Bug fix for default custom tag project data
