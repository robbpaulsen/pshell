CFML v0.17.0 Changelog:

- Added completions for built-in function parameters where there is list of
  possible values available in cfdocs.org data. For example, when entering an
  algorithm for the `hmac()` function, a list of possible algorithms will be
  offered.

- This release will be the last release that supports Sublime Text build 3083. At
  this point there have been a number of beta releases beyond 3083, so everyone
  has access to a ST version that supports the newer `.sublime-syntax` format for
  syntax highlighting. It is time consuming to support the `.tmLanguage` variant of
  the CFML syntax, and it no longer seems necessary.
