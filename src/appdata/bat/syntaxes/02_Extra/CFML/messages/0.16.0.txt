CFML v0.16.0 Changelog:

- Added attribute name scope to component `extends` keyword
  https://github.com/jcberquist/sublimetext-cfml/issues/49

- Added options to control the verboseness of completions for built-in functions
  as well as for completions from indexed components. There are two new package
  settings for these: `cfml_bif_completions` and `cfml_cfc_completions`.
  Both of these have three options: `basic`, `required`, and `full`. When set
  to `basic`, completions using only the function name will be inserted. When set
  to `required`, only required arguments will be included in the completion, and
  no argument types. Setting these to `full` will cause all arguments to be
  included in the completions, and argument types will be included as well.

  This last setting (`full`) matches the behavior of the completions till now -
  HEADS UP, I have changed the default completion style to `required`. To get the
  previous completion style back, you just need to override these settings in your
  user package settings file.

- Added completion docs that display alongside the auto-complete when entering
  function call parameters. These docs are available when entering parameters for
  built-in functions, as well as parameters for indexed components.

  For the built-in functions, the documentation from cfdocs.org for that function
  parameter is displayed. For indexed components, the doc includes the parameter
  type, whether it is required, and its default value, if it has one. If the
  parameter has a docblock hint, that will be displayed as well.

  These completion docs are enabled by default, but you can turn them off by setting
  the package setting `cfml_completion_docs` to false in your user package settings.
