CFML v0.24.0 Changelog:

- Updated cfdocs.org popups to include display of param types. This was
  contributed by Matthew Brown (@KamasamaK) in release v0.23.1 but didn't get
  noted in the changelog.

- There has been a major update to the syntax highlighting files that
  incorporates work done by Thomas Smith (@Thom1729) on the default JavaScript
  syntax (see https://github.com/sublimehq/Packages/issues/1009). The CFScript
  syntax is now able to exactly match expressions, and determine when they
  terminate. This allows for significantly greater precision when parsing CFML
  files. For example, consider the following line:

    function go( param = a + b c ) {}

  Correctly parsing syntax like that to identify `a + b` as an expression and
  `c` as metadata (tag attribute effectively) was basically impossible
  before, but is easy now.

  My thanks to Thomas Smith for letting me use his work and for helping me out
  with it.

  Please note that most of the work on this update was done using Sublime Text
  build 3142, which has had several bug fixes to the syntax highlighting engine
  since 3126. The tests I have in place do pass on 3126, but please let me know
  if you encounter any issues when using that build.

- The CFScript syntax now distinguishes prefix, postfix, and binary operators.
  Whitespace formatting of operators has been updated to take advantage of
  this. (E.g. `i = -1;` will no longer get formatted to `i = - 1;` when
  formatting with spacing around binary operators.)
