CFML v0.6.0 Changelog:

- The CFScript syntax has been overhauled.
  It is now a mod on top of Will Bond's amazing JavaScript syntax rewrite at
  https://github.com/sublimehq/Packages/blob/master/JavaScript/JavaScript.sublime-syntax

  The new syntax is more accurate, and file parsing is significantly faster. The
  previous version of the CFScript syntax took ~150ms to parse FW/1's `one.cfc`
  (at 2883 lines) on my desktop and ~210ms on my laptop. The new version takes
  ~45ms on my desktop and ~70ms on my laptop.

- Unquoted tag attribute values should now correctly highlight CFScript contained
  between `#` characters

- The matching of ColdFusion style tags in script has been restricted to match only
  actual tag names
