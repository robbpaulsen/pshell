CFML v0.9.1 Changelog:

- Fixed a bug that caused the plugin to incorrectly determine the name of the
  folder that it was installed in. This came about due to recent changes in
  how plugins are loaded by ST (in build 3112, I think). Thanks to @mjhagen
  for reporting the issue to me.

- various syntax highlighting updates, see the recent commits on GitHub for
  more details
