CFML v0.25.0 Changelog:

- Added a TestBox Spec component outline command. Similar to the symbol list,
  this command collects all the title param strings in a spec component and
  displays them in an indented list for easy navigation and search. My thanks
  to Eric Peterson (@elpete) for suggesting and testing this.

  In order to use this you need to run the `testbox_spec_outline` command when
  a TestBox Spec component is open. I have not added a default key binding for
  this command, but an example binding you can add to your user key binding
  file is given here:

    {
        "keys": ["ctrl+alt+t"],
        "command": "testbox_spec_outline",
        "context": [
            {"key": "selector", "operand": "source.cfml", "operator": "equal"}
        ]
    }

- Syntax highlighting fixes, see the recent commits on GitHub for more details
