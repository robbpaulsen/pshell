CFML v0.3.0 Changelog:

- Added tmPreferences file that marks CFML files as source files for sidebar icons
  This ensures that the file_type_source icon in themes is applied to CFML files

  See https://github.com/jcberquist/sublimetext-cfml/blob/master/metadata/cfml-icon.tmPreferences
  If a copy of this file is placed in your User package folder, you can override
  `file_type_source` with another icon type, depending on what your active theme supports.
  For example, Material Theme (https://github.com/equinusocio/material-theme) has two
  icon types for CFML files: `file_type_cfc` and `file_type_cfm`.
