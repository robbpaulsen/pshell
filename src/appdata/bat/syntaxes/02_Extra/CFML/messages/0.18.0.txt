CFML v0.18.0 Changelog:

- Removed `.tmLanguage` support from the package. The previous tagged release
  (v0.17.0) will be the last release containing `.tmLanguage` syntax files.

- Fixed an issue where, when indexing custom tag files, a file read failure on
  an individual file was preventing the custom tag index from being generated.

- Persistent components are now indexed via their entity names when they are
  contained in a project `cfc_folders` array. This index is used to offer
  entity name completions when using the ORM functions `entityNew()`,
  `entityLoad()`, and `entityLoadByPK()`.

  Also, using that same index, method completion support for variables
  referencing persistent components has been added. For example, given
  `myVar = entityLoadByPK("myentity", 1)`, after typing `myVar.`, completions
  will be offered for the `myentity.cfc` component. (If the `entityname`
  attribute is specified, it does takes precedence over the file name in
  determining the component entity name.) This support also extends to the F1
  documentation command, as well as the CTRL+ALT+click go to source command.

  If you wish to disable this behavior you can set the package setting
  `instantiated_component_completions` to `false` in your user package settings.
