CFML v0.19.0 Changelog:

- Removed `cfml-icon.tmPreferences` which set a default sidebar icon for
  CFML files. This package is now supported by the "zz File Icons" package
  (https://packagecontrol.io/packages/zz%20File%20Icons) and specifying an
  icon in the package conflicted with it.

- When running TestBox tests via the build menu, the root folder(s) of your
  project will be searched for a `box.json` file containing a testbox runner
  setting, if you do not specify a testbox runner in your project file.
  Please see https://github.com/jcberquist/sublimetext-cfml#testbox for more
  details. IMPORTANT, if you have been using the TestBox runner, this update
  includes a BREAKING CHANGE with regard to the structure of the TestBox
  settings. See also:

- Custom tag indexing support has been updated to allow the omission of the
  `prefix` key when specifying custom tag folders in your project file. When
  this is done, custom tags in that folder will be offered as `<cf_customtag>`
  style completions.
