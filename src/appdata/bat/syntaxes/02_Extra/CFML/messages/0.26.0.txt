CFML v0.26.0 Changelog:

- The format in which inline document popups are displayed has been simplified
  and standardized. With this change, the setting `adaptive_doc_styles` no
  longer has any effect and has been removed. Also, when viewing the popup for a
  method of a component, the code preview is no longer displayed by default, but
  it can be added back by setting `cfml_doc_method_preview` to true in your CFML
  package settings.

- A new method preview command has been added that is bound to SHIFT+F1 by
  default. When the cursor is on a method that can be previewed (one where you
  can get method documentation) and the command is run, it will display the
  preview right below the method call. The preview can be closed by pressing
  SHIFT+F1 again or by clicking on the `x`.

- A basic indent settings file has been added for CFScript. At the moment it is
  a clone of the one included in the default packages for JavaScript. This
  should provide a better experience when the cursor is between curly braces
  `{}` and enter is pressed.

- In an effort to reduce false positives when indexing components, the indexer
  now tries to identify comment and string ranges in component files, so that
  commented out functions and the like are no longer identified as valid
  functions. This does add some overhead to the time it takes to index files, so
  a cache has been added. The cache is stored in a sqlite3 database that is
  stored in your User package folder at `./CFML/cfc_index_cache.sqlite`.

PLEASE RESTART SUBLIME TEXT TO ENSURE THESE CHANGES ARE LOADED CORRECTLY, THANKS!
