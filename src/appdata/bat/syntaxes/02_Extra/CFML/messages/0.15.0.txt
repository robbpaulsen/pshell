CFML v0.15.0 Changelog:

- `writeOutput` key binding now outputs a semicolon after the parentheses
  matching the `writeDump` key binding
  https://github.com/jcberquist/sublimetext-cfml/pull/44

- Fixed syntax highlighting and cfc completions for function parameter types
  containing component dot paths
  https://github.com/jcberquist/sublimetext-cfml/issues/45

- Component completions no longer include private methods in contexts where
  those methods are not callable
  https://github.com/jcberquist/sublimetext-cfml/issues/43

- Added basic method completion support for variables referencing instantiated
  components.

  For example, given `myVar = new path.to.component()`, after typing `mycfc.`,
  completions will be offered for `path/to/component.cfc`.

  This support is somewhat limited, and it may collide with the completions
  offered by the already extant cfc completions using `cfc_folders`. If you wish
  to disable it you can set the package setting `instantiated_component_completions`
  to `false` in your user package settings.

  In order for these completions to work, the component in question must be
  indexed in a project `cfc_folders` array and there must be a mapping specified in
  the project `mappings` array such that the path to the component can be deciphered.
  (If pressing F1 on `new path.to.component()` brings up the component documentation,
  then things are setup properly.)
