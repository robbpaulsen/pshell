CFML v0.12.2 Changelog:

- Better error handling when indexing components
  The file path of a component that causes an indexing error
  is printed to the console along with the error traceback.

- Added a command to the command palette that can be used to
  trigger a re-indexing of the project in the active window:
  `CFML: Index Active Project`
