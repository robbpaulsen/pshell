CFML v0.28.0 Changelog:

- Updated the "CFML: Toggle Color Scheme Styles" command to use of the new
  `.sublime-color-scheme` format and customizations. See the readme for more
  information as well as the official documentation:
  https://www.sublimetext.com/docs/3/color_schemes.html#customization

- Hovering over a CFML tag attribute or using F1 on it will now show specifically
  the documentation for that tag attribute instead of for the tag in general.

- When completion docs are enabled, tag attribute documentation will now be shown
  while entering in tag attribute values.

- Syntax highlighting support has been added for ordered structs and ACF2018
  typed arrays.

- Basic function completions have been updated to be based on a more recent version
  of cfdocs.org function data.

PLEASE RESTART SUBLIME TEXT TO ENSURE THESE CHANGES ARE LOADED CORRECTLY, THANKS!
