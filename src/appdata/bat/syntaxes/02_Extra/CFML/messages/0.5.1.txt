CFML v0.5.1 Changelog:

- Added 'cfdump', 'cfinclude', and 'cfprocessingdirective' to the default list
  of tags that do not receive a closing tag

- The default mouse binding on the Mac for opening component files has been
  changed from CMD+ALT+Click to CTRL+ALT+Click. This was done because
  CMD+ALT+Click is the default mouse binding for selecting text by column
  on the Mac.

- The click to open component file and F1 documentation commands should now work
  on any quoted string containing a dot path to a component. (Assuming the correct
  mapping has been set up in a project file.)
